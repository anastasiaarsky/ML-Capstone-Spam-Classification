1. As discussed, there are few SMS Spam datasets available online. The only one I was able to find was on the 
UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection. There is also a 
duplicate data set available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset), 
but I have chosen to use the orginal data set from the UCI Repository.
2. No code was needed to collect the data.
3. Data set is in the SMSSpamCollection.txt file.
