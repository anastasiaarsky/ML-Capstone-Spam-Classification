# ML Capstone

## Description

Spam is unwanted and unsolicited messages sent electronically. These spam messages often have malicious intent, and range from misleading advertising to phishing and malware spreads. Thus, spam is detrimental to both users and services, and creates mistrust and wariness between the two parties. 

Furthermore, SMS spam is rapidly on the rise, with the Federal Trade Commision reporting $8.8 billion in total reported losses in 2022, compared to the $6.1 billion in 2021 and the mere $1.2 billion in 2020 ([FTC.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/02/ftc-crunches-2022-numbers-see-where-scammers-continue-crunch-consumers)). Therefore, it is increasingly important for companies and services to detect and filter spam messages. 

My capstone project aims to create an ML model that is capable of detecting spam SMS messages.

I will be utilizing a public set of 5,574 SMS messages in English from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection#) that have been collected for mobile phone spam research. The tagging standard was defined as **ham** (legitimate) or **spam**.

Here are some examples:
`ham What you doing?how are you?`
`ham dun say so early hor... U c already then say...`
`spam FreeMsg: Txt: CALL to No: 86888 & claim your reward of 3 hours talk time to use from your phone now! ubscribe6GBP/ mnth inc 3hrs 16 stop?txtStop`
